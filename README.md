# Python Bayesian Spam Filter
 We receive a lot of mails but our mailbox automatically sorts the spams out and only take hams (the mail that you want, opposite of spams) in our inbox. How exactly does our mailbox calcualte whether the mail is a spam or not? This is a spam filter implemented in python to showcase the use of Naive Bayes Classifier and Bag-of-Words model in the our mail box. <br>

 For a detaile walk-through of the code and explanation of the theories, please look at https://github.com/charliezcr/Python-Bayesian-Spam-Filter/blob/master/Spam_filter.ipynb or https://charliezcr.github.io/SpamFilter.html<br>
 If you are more interested in the code itself, please read the python script https://github.com/charliezcr/Python-Bayesian-Spam-Filter/blob/master/spam.py <br>
 The rest txt files are training and testing data. <br>
